# hobby-mvcc-framework
A hobby js model-view-controller-coordinator framework for canvas ui applications

## "Compilation"

All framework code resides in the `src/` folder. Technically any part of the
Framework could be loaded and used idividually, but for convenience sake a
script called `bundle.sh` can be called to concatenate all the files into a
single file called `MVCC.js`. For now, that's litterally all the script does.
In the future this will likely be someone more involved.
